Van Lu: The password you gave me did not work for the cabinet. Are there any other options?

Odin: It is possible that the password was changed by Andrei Lem. He often complained about the simplicity of the cabinet passwords.

Odin: The "Odyssey" is a cutting-edge scientific research spaceship equipped with advanced systems and technologies for exploring the uncharted depths of space. On board, there are two independent artificial intelligences, One and Icarus, which ensure the safety and comfort of the crew. The laboratory and autonomous drones allow for the investigation of various celestial objects.
* [Why does the ship have two artificial intelligences?] -> Branch1
* [Good. I wanted to ask something else.] -> FirstDialogWithProgrammer
-> END

== Branch2_1
Odin: The two artificial intelligences on board the "Odyssey" spacecraft are designed to ensure the safety and seamless operation of all systems. In case of failure of one AI, the other can take over its functions and prevent problems. Additionally, each AI is responsible for certain systems: I am responsible for navigation and control over the generator, while Ikar is responsible for research and the life support system. This provides more reliable operation of the ship and increases the safety of the entire crew.
* [There is something to think about.] -> FirstDialogWithProgrammer

Transmitter: Communication interrupted.

Van Lu: This is some kind of madness. It can't be that she... One, did you hear that too?

Odin: There were strong interference on the station frequency, but there definitely is someone there.

Odin: We have arrived at the station, get ready for the expedition.

Odin: The gateway door is now open.
