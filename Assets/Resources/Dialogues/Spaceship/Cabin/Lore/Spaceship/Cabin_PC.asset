  - "Entry in Diary\n\nNovember 3, 2112\n I have finally achieved the position of
    Inspector of Scientific Planning, or as everyone calls them, Inpies. I have been
    through a lot to become the best candidate for this role. But I have a feeling
    that the commission chose me not for my achievements, but rather for my failure
    in the field of Noostics. How familiar to me are its drawbacks and the laboriousness
    of conducting experiments that have not paid off for more than ten years. During
    this time, more priority areas of science have emerged, which suffer from a lack
    of funding.\n"
  - "December 15, 2112\n I rarely write down my thoughts, only when feelings come
    over me, like now, feelings of the past. As I suspected, the commission chose
    me for the position as an excellent opportunity to close the funding for Noostics.
    The study of extraterrestrial intelligent class S asteroids does not meet the
    five-year plan of the research institute. There are virtually no grounds left
    to support research stations, and hoping for a sudden breakthrough in this area
    is very naive. Despite the fact that Noostics turned out to be my biggest disappointment,
    I am very sorry that it turned out this way. Who knows how my life could have
    turned out if I had not met her on this station, even though it no longer exists.

  - "February 1, 2113\nCommission sent me to the Einomia station as part of a 3-member
    crew, including myself. The mission was supposed to last approximately 2 months.
    Almost 3 years later, I returned to this forgotten station, to finally put an
    end to its dying agony. Mentally, I was prepared to be sent to the station, but
    why do I feel so depressed? Perhaps it's because of the contemptuous looks of
    my former colleagues, who see me as a traitor? No, I don't care about these stubborn
    rams who wait for a reaction, poking a stick at a long-dead corpse. It's her,
    the one I lost, but still love, I think. Maybe I'm just imagining it, and memories
    have taken on a too naive shade. By closing the Einomia station, I hope that
    this feeling will leave me completely, leaving only dull memories.\n \u0442\u0443\u0441\u043A\u043B\u044B\u0435
