  - 'A report on the comparison of economic growth and the well-being of the average
    citizen of Earth in recent years indicates a positive trend in this area. The
    advancement of robotics and its implementation in the corporate environment of
    our factories has led to a reduction in working hours without a decrease in wages,
    allowing people to devote more time to their personal lives. This technological
    breakthrough was the result of harmonious interaction between scientists, engineers,
    and managers. However, it is worth considering: would this breakthrough have
    occurred without our scientific planning committee?'
  - Last year, our scientists implemented a plan to apply their areas of research
    to the everyday life of people. They explored robotics, planetary geology, social
    groups, and in particular, the development of Pavlovian artificial intelligence
    in the economic levers of our planet. However, there are also lagging areas,
    such as Noostika, a promising science that studies intelligent extraterrestrial
    objects such as S-class asteroids. However, their research has hit a dead end.
  - 'It has been discovered that S-class asteroids can interact with humans and send
    primitive signals, completely overturning our understanding of extraterrestrial
    life. There are theories that beyond our solar system, there may be entire planets
    with a rational noosphere. Currently, only three such asteroids are known: Ceres,
    Pallas, and Eunomia. Their study could give people a deep understanding of the
    universe and the possibilities of human intelligence, which could reach a new
    level of evolution. However, despite the potential of this area and its potential
    in studying rational extraterrestrial objects, Noostika has encountered obstacles.
    In connection with this, the Scientific Planning Committee has decided to reduce
    funding for this area and close the Russian-Chinese expedition on the Eunomia
    and Ceres asteroids, leaving only research on the Pallas asteroid.'
