  - 'Three days have passed in my laboratory, and I am still here. It is worth looking
    at the hologram of a person''s brain, and new notes overwhelm me. I have received
    the latest data from neurobiologists, and now I have the key to studying the
    connection of the human brain and Noosphere, the supposed collective human mind.
    I am convinced that our brain is just a small part of this collective mind, and
    if we learn to understand its functions and properties, we will reveal the potential
    of human reason.

    I am studying this data, constantly analyzing every aspect,
    in search of new discoveries. I feel that I am on the threshold of something
    grand, and my research will lead to a new understanding of consciousness. My
    colleagues may think that this is an illusion, and that my research may be limited
    by the current financial capabilities. But I know that this is not the case,
    and that my research can change our view of human reason.

    I feel that there
    is a deep meaning in this world, and I am determined to find out. I will continue
    to work until I achieve my goal.'
