  - "Entries from the chief engineer's diary on the Einomia station - part 2 \nLife
    on the Einomia station is no longer what it used to be. Everything is happening
    like in a nightmare, and I don't understand what is happening on this station.
    People disappear and then reappear, but they are no longer who they used to be.
    They are like rough impressions of their former personalities. The research group
    that disappeared in the asteroid mines a long time ago has still not appeared
    on the horizon. And the station continues to be haunted by the ghosts of people
    unknown to me, as if from another world. I tried to talk to them, but they behave
    so strangely that it begins to scare me. I tried to send a distress signal, but
    someone destroyed the entire bridge and destroyed the transmitter. The only way
    to communicate with the outside world is through the entries in this diary. There
    are almost no living people on the station except for those ghosts wandering
    around at a distance. I will go to the mines to find the research group. I hope
    they are still alive and can help me find out what is happening on this cursed
    station. However, I fear that every second on the Einomia station becomes more
    dangerous. I have to be careful and not fall into the traps that may be waiting
    for me at every step. But I can't leave my colleagues, the researchers, in danger.
    I will go to the mines and do everything possible to find out what is happening
    and how we can save ourselves from this nightmare."
