  - "Diary of the chief engineer at the Eynomia station - part 1\n The prolonged
    studies at the Eynomia station have not produced tangible results, and this is
    causing increasing concern among our team. The lack of any progress in the work,
    against the backdrop of rumors about the possible closure of the station... Tension
    on the station is constantly growing. Recently, a new leading scientist, Eshar
    Stanislavski, was appointed to replace the former project leader. Eshar presented
    his theory of Noostika development and described how to stimulate the noosphere
    of the asteroid by neutron radiation. However, the implementation of this project
    requires huge investments and time, and it is unknown if we have enough time
    for this. Despite all the difficulties, the team has prepared the necessary equipment
    for noosphere irradiation. However, the chief constructor, Damien, expressed
    his concerns about the reliability of the device. The first experimental tests
    did not produce significant changes in the Noosphere. Despite this, Eshar proposes
    to increase the power of radiation, but this is associated with serious risks.
    A tragedy occurred. The device for noosphere irradiation overheated, and the
    capsules with the rods melted, causing radiation exposure to part of the personnel.
    Several scientists did not survive, and the remaining people began to behave
    strangely, as if they had lost their identity. The research group that went into
    the asteroid mines also disappeared. Unfortunately, communication with the outside
    world is disrupted, the bridge is destroyed, and the transmitter is destroyed.
    Only the ghosts of people are on the station, wandering back and forth, but they
    behave so strangely that it is unbearable."
